Let's try to make some changes in model Course

Specifically let's change title = models.CharField(max_length=255) into:
max_length = 300
Save file 

-- let's now go again to terminal and create migrations again because our model got changed,
but in database there is old data max_length=300 :

Create migrations running :  python manage.py makemigrations
- now we can see that a new migration appread in migrations folder
new migrations file is : 0002_alter_course_title.py
--Also we can see message description in terminal  - 'Alter field title on course'


# Inside 0002_alter_course_title.py :
we see that there is a list of dependencies, that says Django that current migration
depends on the list dependensies:

    dependencies = [
        ('shop', '0001_initial'),
    ]
Specifically 0001_initial.

### And after we see operations code to be made for this migrations 
Specifically:

    operations = [
        migrations.AlterField(
            model_name='course',
            name='title',
            field=models.CharField(max_length=300),
        ),
    ]

migrations.AlterField --> change specific field for course model, particularly
'title' field, and there we want to change the max_length to 300.
------
Now let's apply this migration with:
' python manage.py migrate '

Yes, now going to DB Browser we can see that the value changed from 255 to 300.


!!!  It is important to plan the look of datbase before creating the database, 
because for instance  if we are changing the type of field from flaot to int,
if there are already values in there, we will face issues 


# Now our databases are up to date and all of the migrations are applied.
