# lets create a superuser:
'python manage.py createsuperuser'
asks for Username : lets do for isntance 'abdu'
email : adalerzdoa2@gmail.com
password : 12345

# SuperUser is successfully created.

# now using credentials we are in the administrative part of our Django project

# There if for instance we will try to change the password we are gonna be redirected to here:
http://localhost:8000/admin/password_change/
this url is given to us by 'path('admin/', admin.site.urls)' from base.urls file.

--- so admin.site.urls continues http://localhost:8000/admin/.

## So from the box Django provide users and groups that are integrated with Sqlite

- For instance, Now we can go to DB browser and there go to table  ' auth_user ' :
- Here we can see all the users and their info: abdu, ... .
