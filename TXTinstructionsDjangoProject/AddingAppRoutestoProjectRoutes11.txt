got urls in base and change 'from django.urls import path' into:
'from django.urls import path, include'

include('shop.urls') # says django that we want to include all of the routes
that are in shop.urls into our App so that:
all of the routes from shop app will be available via address 'shop/'

# now when we go localhost:800/shop 

we can see message: Hello from the Shop App
