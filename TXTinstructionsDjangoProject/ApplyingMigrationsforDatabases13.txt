As we remember we had such problem:

You have 18 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

# As we know Django takes all the work of working with Databases on itself

For the correct working of all these apps rom setting.py:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]

It is required to have tables in database for it to work.

# AS we chekced our database now with DB browser, our database was empty,
thats why for this reason we are getting this migration error.

# So it means that our database is not yet configured for the apps that were activated by dafult in 
Django in the list above.

A migration in Django is a file that tells Django how to create or change database tables so they match your models.

# So for this reason we have to apply these migrations, 
and we dont have to write any SQL requests independently. Django will do it for us.
We just have to run this commmand : 'python manage.py migrate' to apply unapplied migrations.
Right now we have 18 of them, for apps: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions

--# Now going to DB Browser we can see several tables appeared
