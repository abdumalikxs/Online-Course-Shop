views.py now loks like this:

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse  # importing HttpResponse class
# Create your views here.


def index(request):     # request that we get from user
    return HttpResponse('Hello from the Shop App')

# Now we should connect this VIEW_FUNCTION to specific routing for our shop app:
for this we should create identical file like urls.py in base dir but in shop dir.

urls.py in base ---> is for the whole project
urls.py in shop --> is for specific app Shop

# Now we have created urls.py in shop
in this file we should define all the routes for shop app

as we wanted our view function to return text when being in the root page lets 
implement it like this :

urlpatterns = [
    path('') # expects from us a route and a view function (route, view)
]

# '' - empty string means root path for specific app
