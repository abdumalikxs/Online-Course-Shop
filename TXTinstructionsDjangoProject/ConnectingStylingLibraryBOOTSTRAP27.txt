For styling web-pages we need CSS styles.
And we can basically create a separate CSS file for our project, 
but for making process fast, let's use 
A ready library Bootstrap.

Let's google Bootstrap, and there download it
got to CDN via jsDelivr.
from there we need the first link:
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.8/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-sRIl4kxILFvY47J16cr9ZwB07vP4J8+LH7qKQnuqkuIAvNWLzeN8tE5YBujZqJLB" crossorigin="anonymous">

We dont need js file so only copy first line.

Now go to templates/courses.html 
and in the firstt line before <table> let's add a Header of html document

<head>  ...here... </head>

and put the link into is place  ...here...

save and go back to our Shop interface page browser 
and refresh it.

NOW, we see that some styles were applied to our page


### And now we can add some classes for our table and those classes 
are already included in bootstrap Library


Let's go back to our .html and for html tag <table> let's convert it into this:

<table class="table mt-5 table-border table-striped table-hover">

In here :
‚Ä¢	table ‚Üí Applies Bootstrap‚Äôs base table styling (padding, borders, font alignment).
‚Ä¢	mt-5 ‚Üí Adds a top margin (mt = margin-top, 5 = spacing size). It pushes the table down from elements above it.
‚Ä¢	table-bordered ‚Üí   to show borders around all table cells.
‚Ä¢	table-striped ‚Üí Adds zebra-striping (alternating row background colors).
‚Ä¢	table-hover ‚Üí Highlights a row when the user hovers over it.


So here how .html gets imported library:

‚Ä¢	That <link> tells the browser: ‚ÄúGo fetch this CSS file from the Bootstrap CDN (a public server).‚Äù
‚Ä¢	The CSS file is all of Bootstrap‚Äôs styles bundled together (thousands of predefined classes).
‚Ä¢	Once the browser downloads it, all the .table, .btn, .mt-5, etc. styles are available in your page.
‚Ä¢	So when you write <table class="table mt-5 table-striped">, the browser checks its active stylesheets, finds those classes in the Bootstrap file you linked, and applies them.



NOW, going back to our page we see beautiful table there.

LEt's also change the style for a header of our page and make it Darker.


For this we should add an HTML tag class in <thead> and it will look like this:
  <thead class="table-dark">

Yes now we see the first row(thead) is dark.


Also let's add styles fro the buy buttons:

<button class="btn btn-primary">Buy</button>

YEAH , NOW IT CHANGED into blue color!



SO Basically here is exactly what happens with classes : 

The class attribute in HTML is just a label you attach to an element.
CSS (or libraries like Bootstrap) define styles for those class names.
When the browser sees class="table mt-5", it looks up all matching styles and applies them together.
You can list multiple classes separated by spaces, and their styles will be combined.
In our Case Bootstrap is loaded from CSS file located in some server.


IN BOOSTRAP SITE WE CAN ALWAYS GO TO EXAMPLES PAGE AND ALSO SEE THE DOCUMENTATION
ON USING VARIOUS STYLES.

FOR instance if we go to images documentation we can see how we can style 
various images using bootstrap


Next, we will talk about how we can use one common Template,
for instance which has MENU on top of the page for other different Templates.

In other words the way we can include one template into the other one.

üëâ In plain words:
‚Ä¢	Instead of writing the same code (like a menu bar, header, footer) 
inside every HTML file, you can make one common template that has those shared parts.
‚Ä¢	Then, other templates (like your product page, courses page, etc.) 
can include or extend that common template.

THIS ALL IS MADE POSSIBLE THANKS TO DJANGO.

also to note:
We put the Bootstrap link in <head> so the page knows the styles first, 
and everything shows up nicely styled right away.
