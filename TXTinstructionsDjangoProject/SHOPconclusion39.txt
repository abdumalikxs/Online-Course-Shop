We created this app 


Next we will create an app called API and using that app we will 
implement RestAPI service in order to be able to get Data about courses and categories
from database in JSON format.

And we will do so that we will be able to read and for instance create new records
in our Database.

- Meaning our API service will accept both GET and POST requests and even DELETE requests.
