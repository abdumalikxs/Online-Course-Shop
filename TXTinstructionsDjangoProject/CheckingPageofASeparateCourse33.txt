we implemented routing and created new pages with Sending
 ID dynamically so that we now have access for these all:

http://localhost:8000/shop/1
http://localhost:8000/shop/2
http://localhost:8000/shop/3
http://localhost:8000/shop/4


To make it look beautiul template let's alsso add a bootstrap tag to <h1>:
class="mt-5"


If we want we can also make this page look more beautiful by using bootstrapand finding there doc
named Card.



But when we go to http://localhost:8000/shop/10:
it will give Error and it is a better practice to return page 404 in here.

Let's do this in the next video.
