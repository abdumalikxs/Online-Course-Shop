for now we have 2 templates: base.html , and courses.html.
base being the main template.

let's create a page for information of specific course,
and make so that the names of our courses
in courses table will be links to those pages.


And let's make such a structure for these pages:
http://localhost:8000/shop/1   --  will be link to python course  (1 is ID of the course)
http://localhost:8000/shop/2  and etc ...


For navigation ofcourse we will have to make a routing between the main index page 
and other separate pages of courses.

Let's start it from adding a new route in url.py file which will allow us to go to a 
separate page of a specific course.

!!!!!!
we agreed that we will get course object information from the ID indicated in the url 
link  for instance :  http://localhost:8000/shop/2 .


Let's go to urls.py and add a new routing:
--------------
from django.urls import path
from . import views   # '.' means current directory (package)

urlpatterns = [
    # expects from us a route and a view function (route, view)
    path('', views.index, name='index')
    # since we will use this ID later we should do it like this '<int:course_id>'
    path('<int:course_id>', views.single_course, name='single_course')
]
---------------

<int:course_id> captures an integer from the URL 
and passes it as the variable course_id to the view function as an argument



In next video we will create a ViewFunction for course page.
