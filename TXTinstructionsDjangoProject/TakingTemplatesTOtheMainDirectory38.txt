For big Django projects its better to put templates directory in the root of our project

So let's do it now, and take templates to the root of our project

- I moved it 
let's check if our app is working as expected.
if we refrsh browser it aint working now.

let's go to settings.py in base and go to section called 'TEMPLATES'

there is a setting there :   'APP_DIRS': True


########
'APP_DIRS': True makes Django auto-find templates in each appâ€™s templates/ folder, 
while False means it only uses the paths listed in DIRS.

So that we now have to indicate the path to our templates directory in the 
DIRS list 
for this we can use BASE_DIR that is already in settings.py

Now everything worked fine!


As we now have one directorty in main root dedicated for templates, 
we might get confused if two of our projects need to use the same name for two
different tempaltes.

For these cases we make sub-drectories inside templates.

-let's create a neew sub-dir inside templates naming it shop.
and take courses.html and single_course.html into it.

But let's leave base.html in root of templates folder because we might need to use this base template
in other of our apps.

Now we have to change the pathes to courses.html and single_course.html in the places
where we use them in our shop app. -- We do this in views.py file --

now it should be :
from this : return render(request, 'courses.html', {'courses': courses})
to this: return render(request, 'shop/courses.html', {'courses': courses})

from this: 
return render(request, 'single_course.html', {'course': course})
to this : return render(request, 'shop/single_course.html', {'course': course})

-- shop cuz we put it inside shop which is inside templates.
Django know to searhc tempaltes , but we also should indicate that it is inside shop/...
