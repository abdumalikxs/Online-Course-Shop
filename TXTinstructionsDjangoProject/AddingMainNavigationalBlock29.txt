# Let's add a navigatioanl block on the top of our base template,
so that it will be available for all of our pages.

-let's go to bootstrap page 
add go through docs of NavBar.
Now we won't do this but rather will create our own basic one.

For now in base.html let's add simple navbar with Emmet Abreviature type:

  <body> <!--added navbar inside body first-->
    nav.navbar.navbar-dark.bg-dark
    <main class="container">
      <!--container adds spaces from left and right of object(BootStrap)-->
      {% block content %} {% endblock %}
      <!-- we need this block to include other pages -->
    </main>
  </body>

  this : nav.navbar.navbar-dark.bg-dark

  and click TAB , so we got the code like this created by Emmet:

    <nav class="navbar navbar-dark bg-dark"></nav>

Now inside <nav> ...here... </nav> :

add   div.container and click TAB

now inside created dir add : a.navbar-brand and TAB

 <a href="" class="navbar-brand"></a>

For now leave href="" value empty we will add a link later.

Now add 'Courses Shop' like this:
<a href="" class="navbar-brand">Courses Shop</a>

In future when clicking 'Courses Shop' we will be able to go to 
our main page of our shop app via views index function

Now let's save base.html and refresh the page

Yeah it worked we see Courses shop



In next lesson let's create a page for information of specific course,
and make so that the names of our courses
in courses table will be links to those pages.
