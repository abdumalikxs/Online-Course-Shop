So even going to Courses --> Course object (2) there in 
Category:(field)   we see  Category object(1)

The two non-clear things are Course object(2) and Category object(1) 
it would be great to name them Java... and Programming respectively.

For this let's go back to models.py in shop and for Category class
let's add magic Method __str__.


â€¢In Django admin page in Webbrowser, whenever it needs to list objects 
(for example in dropdowns, tables, or foreign key selectors), 
it internally calls str(obj) on each model instance.
--> and it triggers __str__() magi method.

So basically in web interface Django does print(object)
and thsi thing calls __str__()
But by default it is just like - Course object(1)

Let's do the same thign for Courses.

# Now everywhere we go we can se normal titles instead of thigns like :
Course object(2) and Category object(1) 


ALSO 
actually in this magim method we can return anything for instance instead of title :
self.title + ' ' +  str(self.student_qty)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title + ' ' +  str(self.student_qty) 

        # we converted into str since it was and integer 

So that now we see in web interface things like : Complete Java Guide 80


# Let's add a new course in Web Interface
- add course and write evrything manually
- save
---> yeah nwo we got a new record , and there are total of 3 records as of now.


########
So now, in the next lesson we are going to view(display) courses in web-interface for  
specifically our shop app(http://localhost:8000/shop/).

For now if we go to http://localhost:8000/shop/, 
it only displays this message:
Hello from the Shop App

Instead of this we want to see a table will all of the Courses.
