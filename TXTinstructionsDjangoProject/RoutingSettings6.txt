urls.py ---> is responsible for navigation inside DJANGO apps

--- This code allows us to go to admin page 
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),  
] 

When we go localhost:8000/admin we get redirected to :
localhost:8000/admin/login/?next=/admin/

Specifically admin.site.urls itself is resposible for this part our link:
login/?next=/admin/


admin was imported from django.contrib as we see in the urls.py

# If we comment this part : path('admin/', admin.site.urls), 
we won't be able to get to admins page


In case if we change path('admin/', admin.site.urls) into : 
path('my-admin/', admin.site.urls),

We can now go to admins page via  localhost:8000/my-admin
