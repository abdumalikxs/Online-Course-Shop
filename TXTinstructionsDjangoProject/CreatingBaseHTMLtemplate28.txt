Creating a base common Template:

•	Instead of writing the same code (like a menu bar, header, footer) 
inside every HTML file, you can make one common template that has those shared parts.
•	Then, other templates (like your product page, courses page, etc.) 
can include or extend that common template.

THIS ALL IS MADE POSSIBLE THANKS TO DJANGO.

Usually in most of the webpages there is a base-common parts of the page for the most of the pages.
For instace, a header which shows a menu of buttons login and logout.
And for these cases it is very practical to create an html template
that will be reused in various other pages.

Doing so, in our table case we can take this table into other pages as well.


-- That's why let's create a new Template and call it base.html .
- let's create an html document with Emmet shortcut:
write : '!' and click tab

it didnt work cuz vscode is taking our file format as "Django HTML"

to fix this lets change the settigns of vscode.
now, open settings as json file 
and in the end of the settings add this line:

  "emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "django-html":"html"
  }


-- now again : ! and Tab
it worked.


we got :
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>


Now, again go to courses.html and copy the Bootstrap library link:
  <link
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.8/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
    rel="stylesheet"
    integrity="sha384-sRIl4kxILFvY47J16cr9ZwB07vP4J8+LH7qKQnuqkuIAvNWLzeN8tE5YBujZqJLB"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  />

and put it in header of base.html, so that Bootstrap will be available for 
all pages and will come from base.html  .

let's delete the header in courses.html , since we will be getting the bootstrap link from our 
base.


For now let's not touch the Title of our base.
But inside body, let's  add this thing :

    <main class="container">
        {% block content %}
        {% endblock %}   <!--> we need this block to include other pages -->
    </main>

Why inside <body>

Everything that should actually appear on the webpage goes inside <body>. The <head> is only for metadata (title, CSS links, scripts, etc.). Since the block will output visible content (like text, tables, images), it belongs in <body>.

Why wrapped in <main>
	•	<main> is an HTML5 semantic tag that marks the primary content area of the page.
	•	It tells browsers, screen readers, and search engines: “This is the main unique content of this page.”
	•	Things like navbars, sidebars, and footers are outside <main>.
	•	By putting {% block content %} inside <main>, you’re saying: “Every child page will insert its unique main content here, inside a clean Bootstrap container.”

--> this thing is called Django template block.


What it does:
•	It defines a placeholder (a block) inside your base.html.
•	Other templates (like courses.html, products.html, etc.) that extend base.html can put their own HTML inside this block.
•	When Django renders the page, the block is replaced with the content from the child template.

let's save our base.html file
and go to courses.html



----/ NOW in courses.html we have to indciate the name of 
the template in which our courses.html will be added to.

So for this on top of the courses.html file write:

{% extends 'base.html'%}

- also besides this we should indicate 
which part of the courses.html
will be included in here:
        {% block content %}
        {% endblock %} 

btw we can name it anything we want even :  {% block my-content %}

SO that our final courses.html will look like this :


OVERRALL :
The space between {% block %} and {% endblock %} in the base template 
doesn’t matter—Django replaces it entirely with the child template’s content.


Let's go to Page source, and we see this code successfully being included:
