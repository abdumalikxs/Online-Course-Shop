# before styling html Template in Django,
let's rebiew the MTV thing we have a screenshot in this dir called 'DjangoLayers.png'.


.. take notes from video + take notes from GPT last tab 

So the process is like this : 

DB --> MODEL --> VIEW --> TEMPLATE   

(and if it's done backwards it's called POST request 
 that triggers a Create operation in the cycle.)

 it will look like:

 TEMPLATE --> VIEW --> MODEL --> DB

 Views are interchangers between models and templates.

 Also there are URL's and, variour view functions are connected to various URL's liek here:

 urlpatterns = [
    # expects from us a route and a view function (route, view)
    path('', views.index, name='index')
]


Overall, Template talks to Model via View function
View function talks to Database via Model.
