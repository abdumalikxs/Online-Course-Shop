to initialize API app we installed django-tastypie library

- next, we created models for two resources.
- for those two classes we defined class Meta, with queryset, resource_name, allowed_methods.

For resource we allowed only GET
For course resource we allowed 3 methods get post delete

we created CustomAuthentication for CourseResource
which allows GET for CourseResource to work without authentication


The two apps , shop and api are fully isolated from each other and operate separately.

also in settings.py we added api.apps.ApiConfig
and 'tastypie'
then we applied the migrations and in the database we got two additional tables:
tastypie_apiaccess
tastypie_apikey

and we created a key in admin's panel so that we could do authentication 
when sending post or delete requests.

We donwloaded postman to test various requests.

and also in urls.py base we added a path like this:

path("api/", include(api.urls)) to make this app available for users.
