To do some changes to admin's panel we should go to shop to module admin.py

write these there:
admin.site.site_header = 'Courses Admin'
admin.site.site_title = 'My Courses'
admin.site.index_title = 'Welcome to the Courses admin area'

got update web page with new texts


Now we will do so that we can control categories and courses from the same page

let's first make so that we can see some table fields of courses near their names

We should add a new class with the fields to be displayed:

class CourseAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'price','category')

now we should include this Class as a second arguemtn when we register our class related to it. : 

admin.site.register(models.Category)
admin.site.register(models.Course, CourseAdmin)

Now, we see a better display in the page for Courses with more details about the fields.

Let's do the same for the Category :

class CourseAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'price', 'category')

admin.site.register(models.Category, CategoryAdmin)



---- Now if we go to Category, we see that we can control only time and the title

- But it would be best for us to cotnrol the list of course that are in this category.
changing courses, adding courses, deleting courses

And now lets set it up:

in CategoryAdmin class add a attribute called fieldsets that has a list 
of two tuples inside it.

    fieldsets = [
        (None, {'fields': ['title']}),
        ('Dates', {
            'fields': ['created_at'], 
            'classes': ['collapse']
        })
    ]

-- now we have to connect Course model with Category,
so that insdie Category we can work with Coursesfor this we will add one more class
and will call this class CoursesInline:



Overall admin.py should look like this:

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Course, Category

admin.site.site_header = 'Courses Admin'
admin.site.site_title = 'My Courses'
admin.site.index_title = 'Welcome to the Courses admin area'


class CourseAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'price', 'category')


class CoursesInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = Course
    extra = 1


class CategoryAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'created_at')
    fieldsets = [
        (None, {'fields': ['title']}),
        ('Dates', {
            'fields': ['created_at'],
            'classes': ['collapse']
        })
    ]
    inlines = [CoursesInline]


# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(Category, CategoryAdmin)
admin.site.register(Course, CourseAdmin)

# •	admin.site → the Django admin interface object.
# •	.register(...) → method that tells the admin to include this model.



Now we can see the courses inside each category in admin's panel.

let's hide created_at
for this in CoursesInline add attribteu exclude = ['created_at']
