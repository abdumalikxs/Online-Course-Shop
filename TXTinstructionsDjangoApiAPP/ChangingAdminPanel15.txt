To do some changes to admin's panel we should go to shop to module admin.py

write these there:
admin.site.site_header = 'Courses Admin'
admin.site.site_title = 'My Courses'
admin.site.index_title = 'Welcome to the Courses admin area'

got update web page with new texts


Now we will do so that we can control categories and courses from the same page

let's first make so that we can see some table fields of courses near their names

We should add a new class with the fields to be displayed:

class CourseAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'price','category')

now we should include this Class as a second arguemtn when we register our class related to it. : 

admin.site.register(models.Category)
admin.site.register(models.Course, CourseAdmin)

Now, we see a better display in the page for Courses with more details about the fields.

Let's do the same for the Category :

class CourseAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'price', 'category')

admin.site.register(models.Category, CategoryAdmin)
