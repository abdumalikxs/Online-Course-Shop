Now using the API key that we created we can try to delete a record from Database.

- let's create some random course to experiment with it.
- create course
- let's delete this course now, and for this go to Postman:

- let's first send get request to get all the courses:
GET |  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/courses

- we 5 courses , and the Test course we created has an ID of 5.
- Let's send a delete request and ofcourse now we will add our API key into the header.
DELETE | http://localhost:8000/api/v1/courses/5/
- Now we have to add a header, and the header will be called Authorization
- And the Value for Authorization header will be: 'ApiKey abdu:ierwjfioerfjierfji32949230'
- Before deleting the course let's go to web interface of shop and see if we have Tes Course (yes, there is.)
- Now, go back to postman and send the delete request with the link and the header.
- In status we got Status: 204 No Content.  
--> we are not seing unauthorized anymore , it means that both Authentication and Authorization
were successfully completed because we added a key Authorization.

- let's now send a request to get all of the courses:
GET | http://localhost:8000/api/v1/courses
- Got total of four courses, test Course was deleted.
- let's check it in the Web Interface as well. (Yes, it was deleted)

Overall, this way we successfully deleted the Test course using Delete request.
- go back to terminal where our server runs
- we see [14/Sep/2025 01:29:03] "DELETE /api/v1/courses/5/ HTTP/1.1" 204 0
- The status code is: 204
- Which means resource(course) with id=5 was successfully deleted.


So, as of now we have two of our request methods fucntioning properly those are:
GET and DELETE.



In the next lesson let's try to make available post to create new resources.
which is also allowed in allwoed_methods for CourseResource
