# Now we are gonna see, how using dehydrate module we can change the way , how the data is 
displayed when getting it via get request.

For instance let's change the 'title' of the course to come out in Captial letters.

•	If you define a method like def dehydrate_title(self, bundle):, 
Tastypie automatically looks for dehydrate_<fieldname> when serializing each field.
•	In this case, <fieldname> must match the model/resource field name (title).
•	So if your model has title, Tastypie knows to call dehydrate_title during GET 
requests to modify how that field is returned.


    def dehydrate_title(self, bundle):
        # convert's JSON's title into upper.
        return bundle.data['title'].upper()


-- go to postman and send GET request again.
now we got "COMPLETE PYTHON GUIDE"


    # •	Hydrate = JSON input → model
    # • Dehydrate = model → JSON output
