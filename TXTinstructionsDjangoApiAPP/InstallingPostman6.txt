Now we can see that Get requests are working in webbroser for Courses and Categories
cuz we are seing the JSON when we go ofr courses or specific records.


Now let's try to send DELETE request to delete some course from database.

For this let's install one more app which is called Postman.

Using this app we can send various requests to Api server.

Let's donwload it from browser and open it.

Now in this app we have to create a new request.

For this select GET request and then on the right side write the URL:
http://localhost:8000//api/v1/

and we got this response, same as in normal browser:

{
    "categories": {
        "list_endpoint": "/api/v1/categories/",
        "schema": "/api/v1/categories/schema/"
    },
    "courses": {
        "list_endpoint": "/api/v1/courses/",
        "schema": "/api/v1/courses/schema/"
    }
}

Let's do for this one now : http://localhost:8000/api/v1/categories/

We got this output same as in normal browser.



If we write this: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/courses/10

we are getting Status: 404 Not Found . 
this is the correct response from server in case when the course isnt found

!!!!!!!!!
In Django REST Framework (DRF) or Tastypie, missing or invalid resources are automatically 
handled with proper HTTP error responses like 404, unlike normal Django views where you must 
handle such errors manually with try/except or get_object_or_404.


Okay, now let's try to change the GET request into DELETE.

select DELETE and url http://localhost:8000/api/v1/courses/2 .

click send.

Now we see Status: 200 OK

Although we are supposed to be getting unauthorized

///  the resource was not deleted, Let's make sure that it wasnt by going to
 our frontend and refreshing the page.

 We still have Complete java guide so it wasnt deleted.


-----------------
 Now why we were not able to delete it ?

let's go to the terminal where our server is running.

[13/Sep/2025 16:42:58] "GET /api/v1/courses/10/ HTTP/1.1" 404 0
[13/Sep/2025 16:47:03] "GET /api/v1/courses/2 HTTP/1.1" 301 0
[13/Sep/2025 16:47:03] "GET /api/v1/courses/2/ HTTP/1.1" 200 171
[13/Sep/2025 16:49:06] "DELETE /api/v1/courses/2 HTTP/1.1" 301 0
[13/Sep/2025 16:49:06] "GET /api/v1/courses/2/ HTTP/1.1" 200 171

we see get requests and also a Delete request.

But look at what answer we got for delete request,
it is answer 301 

301 means redirect , which means that the resource was redirected

And if we take a closer look these two for instance:
[13/Sep/2025 16:49:06] "DELETE /api/v1/courses/2 HTTP/1.1" 301 0
[13/Sep/2025 16:49:06] "GET /api/v1/courses/2/ HTTP/1.1" 200 171

we can see that the delete one doesn't have a slash at the end.

---------
By default Django requires a trailing slash (/) on API URLs because APPEND_SLASH=True.
	•	Without / → you get a 301 redirect, and Postman turns your DELETE into a GET.
	•	With / → works correctly.
	•	You can disable this by setting APPEND_SLASH=False, but then you must be consistent with no slashes.
---------

let's add a slash and send a postman again with this:
http://localhost:8000/api/v1/courses/2/


Now we got the right answer Status: 401 Unauthorized
this means server is not allowing us to delete thsi specific resource with id=2.


To be able to delete and create resources using post we have to set up 
authentication and authorization 


Which we will do in the next lesson
