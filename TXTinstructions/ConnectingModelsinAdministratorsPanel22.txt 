Let's check in web Interface in Administrative panel if we have access
to creating and deleting courses and categories.

# as we can see we can work with users and groups but we dont see anything 
related to courses and categories.

To be able to use Courses and Categories we have to register our created models that were for Shop app.

For this we have to go to shop/admin.py:
---> and here we should register our models, 
and as we defined our models in model.py, we should import them from there.

So that admin.py should look like this:
''''''
from django.contrib import admin
from . import models

# Register your models here.

admin.site.register(models.Category)
admin.site.register(models.Course)

	# •	admin.site → the Django admin interface object.
	# •	.register(...) → method that tells the admin to include this model.
'''''''

### Now go to broser and update the page, now we see
Shop
Categorys
Courses

# Clicking shop we will go to Administrative panel of specific SHOP.
# Clicking Categorys, we see a list of categories, in our case it shows 
one element: Category object (1)
If we click Category object (1) , we are gonna see Title: Programming
also Created at : and dates there.

# Later we will learn how to directly name Category object (1) to --> Programming in that list.


ALSO these things happen default in Django admin:
	1.	It detects all fields from your model and makes form inputs for them.
	2.	It prettifies field names by replacing _ with spaces and capitalizing (e.g., created_at → “Created at”).
    3.	It renders inputs based on field type (e.g., DateTimeField → calendar + time picker).


# From admin panel we have access to editing the categories in there.
 - we can delete categories
 - create more categories

 
### Let's go to Courses now :
there is Course object (2) and Course object (1)

Let's click Course object (2):
and here we see all of tthe fields and their Data informations

# let's edit the price for instance into 89.99, and save it.
# database got updated as well and I see 89.99 value.


#### SO, OVERALL :   
The Django admin panel lets us easily add, edit, update, and delete records in our database tables.
(in our case tables Courses and Categories)
