For our Category and Course tables to appear , we should create migrations for our Shop app
and then we should apply these migrations.

For this let's open Terminal and lets create migrations first
- As of now if we open migrations folder inside shop we can see that there are no migrations there.


Run this for creating migrations for all of the registered APPs for our Project:  
' python manage.py makemigrations ' 

# we got this message:
Migrations for 'shop':
  shop/migrations/0001_initial.py      # migrations file created is : 0001_initial.py
    - Create model Category
    - Create model Course

# Now we can  see that in migrations folder there is this  file:   0001_initial.py

Let's open this file and see what is inside it.
# In here we can see the way of creating various Models in python
# !!!NOTE!!! that 'id' field gets created automatically in there :
This particular field is called PRIMARY_KEY.


# So after applying these migrations this python code will be turned into sql requests
which will be executed for database Sqlite3 in our case
