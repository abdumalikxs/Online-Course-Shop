# In django we can create many various apps,
Which we can reuse in many projects in Django.

For instance for internet shop we can : 
create one app for administrative panel for those who will be processing orders
and we can resue this app in other Django projects

We can think of Django apps as a separate componnet of one big Prject(app).

Often one project has many apps that work together and from a bigger app.
And thoe mini apps can be reused in other different apps.


### In terminal run:
   'python manage.py startapp shop'
* A new dir shop appeared on root directory
