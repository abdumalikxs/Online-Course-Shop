Go to setting.py in base

In INSTALLED_APPS write new app's path to its configuration file.
configuration file is apps.py's class, ShopConfig Class of our APP.

so at the end it will look like this:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'shop.apps.ShopConfig'   # Shop is package, apps is module, ShopConfig is class
]


# Now as we have our models in Shop app, 
and have included our app inside INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

Our Task now is to create needed tables inside the DataBase. And we will do it in next lesson. 
(Prolly by creating migrations)
