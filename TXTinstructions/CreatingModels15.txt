Lets now create  a model for our shop app
so that we can interact with database for our app

# lets make one table for categories of courses
# and the second one for courses

So it will be like one Category can have several courses.
This is called ONE-TO-MANY relationship


#### Models are created with a python class, here we are creating two models(two tables):
shop/models.py :

from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone

# Create your models here.
                #parent class
class Category(models.Model):   # Model for a Category
    # now we indicate what fields will be there in database table
    #  we do it using attributes of a class
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255) # Charfield means value will be in 'str' type
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now) # date will be generated automatically

class Course(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.FloatField()
    students_qty = models.IntegerField()
    reviews_qty = models.IntegerField()
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Foreign key means key from a different table
# on_delete=models.CASCADE  --> means that when deleting specific category, 
# automatically the Course instances of it will be deleted as well.
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now) # date will be generated automatically


# Note that all this was made not writing even a line of SQL request
