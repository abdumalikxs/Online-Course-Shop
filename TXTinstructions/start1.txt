Created a new file
Created a new virtual environment inside:
create .venv
pipenv install django
activate Virtual env -> pipenv shell 

Now we can see the list of packages and their dependencies --> pipenv graph


-- # Creating new project with Django.
run --> 'django-admin startproject base .'  (name of the file is base and it will be created in current directory -> ' . ')

- appeared new manage.py
- appeared new base directory

# manage.py is a main operational file which does administrative tasks
# for instance it can run Django Server
# tho server can be ran without this file, this file allows to add some additional settings
