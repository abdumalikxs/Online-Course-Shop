Being in main courses folder run in command line :
(courses) abdumalik@n3-62-156 courses %  '''python manage.py runserver'''

# server was ran locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

If our :8000 port is busy we can run it on a different port with:
python manage.py runserver 9000 --> (some other port)
8000 is usually default

# Also it says: Django version 4.0.8, using settings 'base.settings'
-- We can edit settigns going to base/settings.py

# Also it is saying 18 unapplied migrations which we will learn later

# Let's go to the webpage now:
- we also have access to 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin' our admin page.
- we will work with it later and will give it username and password later
