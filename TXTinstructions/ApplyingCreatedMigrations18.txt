Lets first restart our server.

# Now we again see the migration Alert message in Red:

"""
You have 1 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): shop.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
"""

It says Shop app's migrations need to be applied.

To check, now we have 11 tables in our Project's database.

-- Let's run 'python manage.py migrate' in terminal and the migrations will be applied.

Let's go now to database and update to see if it updated.

---> yes, now we can see that we have 2 more tables : shop_category, shop_course
making up a total of 13 tables.

- Now for instance we can see that shop_category has 3 fields inside: id, title, created_at

- same is for shop_course
-- for instance if we take a look at price field's data type we can see that it is 'real'
 python's float is called 'real' in sqlite


## Switching to Browse Data we can notcie that these two tables are empty.


#/////# So now we Successfully have our Database Tables Because we created and applied migrations
